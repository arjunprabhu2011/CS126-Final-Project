                        FINAL PROJECT PROPOSAL:

For my final project, I would like to create a basketball 
shooting game. In this game, the user will have a time limit 
[probably one minute] to make as many shots as they can. 
The user will have the opportunity to shoot from two different spots
worth two points or three points. For now, I think that I 
will implement it such that the way the user will shoot would 
be to hold down a key on the keyboard. 

I want to complete this project because I have been engrossed into 
basketball since I was a kid. I have always loved the games on the phone
or IPAD involving sports, especially basketball. I am excited to be able to
code a Cinder app to replicate what I played as a kid. I am also excited
to explore more concepts in C++ as well as in Cinder through this 
project.

For a rough timeline, I plan on creating the structure of Objects in the first week.
I plan on doing the backend code for the project largely in the **first** week, but also
in the second week. In the **second** and beginning of the third week, I plan on devoting my
time to completing the Cinder UI part of the project. In the **third** week of 
the project, I plan on finalizing the codebase and adding any additional features to the app.

In terms of additional "stretch goals" that I could implement, I could add in a high score 
for the user. I would have to figure out how to keep track of the 
user's previous scores in the app. I could also add two users to the shooting game
who compete against each other. There is a lot of room for improvement and expansion of this project.
I look forward to getting started!
